# Housing-prices-ml
this project uses data from the Housing Prices competition in Kaggle, this competition gives you a data set of a house , most of it's details , and it's sales price, it also gives you a test set which doesn't have the sales price , and you need to train your model to be able to guess the sales price of the house, based on other information.
